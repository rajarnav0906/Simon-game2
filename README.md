# Simon-game2
Iâ€™ve created a Simon game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. In the game, players can click on buttons corresponding to the sequence of sounds played. They need to remember the previous sequence and replicate it to proceed to the next level. If they make a mistake, they have to start over from the beginning.
